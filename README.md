I_Saw_a_Painting

I Saw a Painting is primarily a gaze based Unity VR game, you will be given about 2 and a half minutes to look around the room as paint blobs start launching in the direction you are looking coloring in and revealing the environment.
After you are done, your room painting will be uploaded online to be stored in a google firebase database, and you will be able to see and share it with others.

<h1>UPDATE 2023: </h1>

google keeps shutting down and wiping my firebase database due to inactivity so at this point this repo exists as an archive of the project, it will not run anymore without the database being up
